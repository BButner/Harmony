# Harmony

## ⚠️ Problem
Have you ever wanted to switch from Spotify to Apple Music? Or vice versa? Maybe your music platform is being shut down and you need to find a new home (Looking at you Google Play Music!)?<br><br>
## ✔️ Solution?
You find a service that allows you to transfer your playlists! Oh, but all their really useful features are behind a paywall, thus making the experience for you worse, as you probably want to use some of those cool tools!<br><br>

## 🚀 In Comes Harmony
We bring that paywall featureset to everyone, for free! *Please note that Harmony is currently in its infancy in the development cycle, and is not released in any form.<br><br>

## 🛠️ Our Features
- Playlist Transferring
  - Multiple Playlists Simultaneously
  - Transfer *and* Combine Playlists
  - Split Playlists by Songs and Transfer
  - Transfer Invidividual Songs from one or multiple Playlists (to an existing or new playlist!)
- Playlist Song Duplication Detection
- Export Playlist Data
- Playlist Management
  - Split Playlists into Multiple
  - Combine Playlists
  - Shuffle Playlist Songs
## <br>💲 What's the catch on "*free*"?
Well... There isn't one! Harmony is a pet project of mine that I plan on keeping completely open source, ad free, non-commercial, and totally free to create a very easy and light user experience. I've found myself in the exact aforementioned situation where I wanted to use the featureset of an existing platform, only to be blocked by a paywall... So why not create my own?<br><br>
